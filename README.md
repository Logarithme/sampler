Polyhex Sampler
===============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/polyhex-sampling/sampler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/polyhex-sampling/sampler)


Description
-----------

Build
-----

To build the sampler, several packages are requires:

* cmake (http://cmake.org) to generate the build project.
* Qt4 (Gui) (http://qt.digia.com) 
* Boost (and boost-progam-options) for command-line parsing (http://boost.org)
* OpenGL
* SDL and SDL_image


A classical commandline build process looks like

    mkdir build  ##Generate build folder
    cd build
    cmake ..     ##Check dependencies and generate a makefile
    make         ##Build

For best performances, you can compile with optimized flags: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`

Once built, several executables are available in `build/bin`:

* `sampler-cli`: 
* `sampler-gui`:
* `sampler-test`: 


Data
----

This program needs full offsets table to produce best sampling distribution.
These tables are heavy (1.5G) and can be downloaded here: http://liris.cnrs.fr/polyhex/data/
